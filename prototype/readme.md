# RaidMaster Prototype

This repository contains a very minimal browser prototype for the **RaidMaster** roguelike project. It is not a complete game, but rather a starting point to experiment with movement and a simple stats display without requiring a full game engine.

## Files

- **index.html** – The main HTML page that loads a `<canvas>` element and includes the game script.
- **main.js** – JavaScript that draws a player square on the canvas and allows movement with the arrow keys or WASD. A basic on‑screen debug overlay shows the player's position and movement speed.

## Running the Prototype

1. Clone this repository or download the `raidmaster_prototype` directory.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser. No web server is required.
3. Use the arrow keys or **WASD** to move the player square around the canvas.

This prototype is intentionally simple so that it can be extended later. In the future, you can replace the canvas logic with a proper framework (like Phaser) and implement more complex mechanics.
